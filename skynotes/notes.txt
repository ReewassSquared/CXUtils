Blockchain is just a special case of immutable data structures

Lebowsky: 
I found something more powerful than Blockchain. 10x.

I need to get documentation/spec people hired, then hire ten developers to each work on component/system/testing and get this out there.

I have something more powerful than both blockchain, CXO and DAG now.

I think this could kill IOTA, Ethereum and IOTA; the point that they are trivial and no longer interesting and everything they do can be done without even using a token or a blockchain.

RumpleSkykin:
I'm getting Radix-vibes from that message.
Are you familiar with the stuff they're working on?
It's DLT that's neither blockchain nor DAG, pretty interesting stuff.
A THIRD CLONE.
MY REASONING FOR A THIRD SPECIFIC EXAMPLE:
They're alright, but it's really the first solution that comes to mind. I think he might have made a premature statement about contracts there, while this part of Radix is still only generally thought through as it is far away. You can't blame him though, he obviously is excited about his project and its future

atoms are still elements, just differentiated

shards are essentially subledgers synced to their own causal web but are immutable on delivery of the larger universe; this is only slightly better than your structure. your as in my own proposed one prior in conversation.

universe is essentially block replacement NO -->speciation!

this is an ergonomic mould of applied data structures but still not an abstract enough representation

there are definitely things in common with all of these things which imply either intrinsic properties of immutable data structures or that everyone is narrow-minded.

BUT WHAT THE FUCK IN THE GOD DAMNED WORLD IS THIS ABSTRACTION

I must know, daddy synth.

erm...
sorry.

nodes are connected to the whole immutable block structure (ledger) = blockchain
nodes are connected partially to the whole structure
(fragmentation of causal map)::(fix with merkle hash commitment check)
but what effect
erm
convoluted set up for fragmentation that works due to reducability can be reduced! RADIX
but hey who's to blame them
nodes create branches in DAG style which are then merged through consensus (not fragmentation, asynchronous setup where nodes can continue to process and then resync on consensus) 

heaviness = fragmentation size consensus = longest chain
ledger structure = ledger structure = ledger structure
immutable data structures all have this in common
connectivity means health, extroversion!
connectivity.
it is a graph.
